# titanicFlask
A web app that predicts the odds of survival of a passenger, given her features. 

This is a simple Flask application to demonstrate deploying a machine learning application as a web app. A pre-trained model is saved as a json file. The Flask app loads the trained model, takes an input from the user through a web browser, and prints the predicted survival status of the person depending on the values entered. As we said, this is a very simple application only to demonstrate basic deployment skills. The code is missing error catching, visual esthetics and other features that may improve user experience.
